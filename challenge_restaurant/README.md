# Challenge Restaurant 2016

Responsible: Rein

## Startup
```
* amigo-start should already be running
* make sure the Jetson is running (check if <robot-name>/pose_detector/openpose is running)
* amigo-challenge restaurant (starts the middleware)
* navigate around for a bit to get a proper gmap
* to get the robot to take the order, answer "<robot-name> take the order"
* when ordering, you can choose a beverage or a combo (food & food). Check the RoboCup knowledge to see what foods and drinks are.
